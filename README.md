Customer Segmentation with Python

The most successful companies today are those that know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs.

This is possible through customer segmentation with K-means Clustering, a Machine Learning model, based on RFM metrics (the most recent, the most frequent and the most spent on our products).

The objective is to identify those customers who have spent the most on our products and acquire them most often to meet their needs, ensure sales, increase inventory turnover and, therefore, profitability.
